/// **Switched from `dart:developer.log`, 2026-07-15** (discovered in
/// `akujamin-v2`, see that project's `MIGRATION_LOG.md`) —
/// `dart:developer.log` is never relayed to the `flutter run` terminal on
/// the web platform (native platforms' terminal picks it up via the VM
/// service; web has no such relay, the call effectively goes nowhere the
/// terminal can see). `logger`'s default output (`ConsoleOutput`)
/// ultimately calls `print()`, which Flutter's tooling *does* relay to the
/// terminal on every platform, web included — this is what actually fixes
/// the visibility gap, not just a cosmetic swap. Uses `PrettyPrinter`
/// (boxed, multi-line, colored) rather than a bare one-liner specifically
/// so app-emitted log lines are visually unmistakable against Flutter's
/// own framework/debug console noise — the whole point of a named-channel
/// logger is lost if its output looks like everything else scrolling past
/// it.
